# Financial Metrics and Global Stock Market Analysis
This project explores how U.S. economic metrics (such as GDP, inflation rate, and unemployment rate) impact the performance of major world stock exchanges. Using Python and the FRED API, we retrieve economic data and compare it with stock price data obtained via the Yahoo Finance API.

Data that retreived from FRED API:
1. GDP (Gross Domestic Product): 'GDP'
2. Unemployment Rate: 'UNRATE'
3. Inflation Rate (CPI - Consumer Price Index): 'CPIAUCSL'
4. Federal Funds Rate: 'FEDFUNDS'
5. Consumer Confidence Index (CCI): 'UMCSENT'
